# Cherry-Bloom-Prediction

## How to check out our data?

Under ```Cherry-Bloom-Prediction/data```, there are five floders. 

The four folders named by the cities contain the corresponding data. For example, in ```Cherry-Bloom-Prediction/data/washington```, you can see the datasets we used to trian our model.

## How do reproduce our result using RStudio?

```diff
- Make sure you cloned the entire repository to your local machine before running the code.
```

Under ```Cherry-Bloom-Prediciton/code```, there are directories named by different algorithems. In each folder, there's a rmd file and a PDF/HTML file. The rmd file is our source code and the PDF/HTML file is knitting result by RStudio.

We also have tried implementing LSTM. It's written in Google's colab using TensorFlow.
