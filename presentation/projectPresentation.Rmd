# Final Paper 

Many cities are known for their cherry blossom viewing sites, and every year, thousands of tourists visit those places to watch cherry blossoms. However, a lot of tourists  on the social media complained that either they went to the viewing sites but the cherry had not bloomed or the cherry had already started to wither. Two of our team member had this experience themselves. Thus, it is crucial for the tourists to know the cherry blossom dates to arrange their trips, which will help them save money and time. 

In this paper, we explore the 6 predictors daily precipitation, average temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, UV index, and pressure, utilizing various models to predict cherry blossom dates at Washington, D.C. (USA), Kyoto (Japan), Liestal-Weideli (Switzerland) and Vancouver, BC (Canada).
